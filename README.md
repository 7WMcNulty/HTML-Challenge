# Reveal-n-Hide
This challenge project will selectively hide or reveal parts of an HTML page.  Open the project and test it out in the browser before you start digging in Atom to look at the code.


## Your Explanation
Look over the code extensively and craft an explanation for how it works.  After you have talked over your hypotheses with a teammate add you thoughtfull response to this README file. Yes this file, type it below here...

The script tag links the html to the js like the link tag does for css.  The onclick runs the js function when the button is clicked on.
The toggle function starts by getting all the articles and putting them into an array.  If the article selected isn't visible, then the reveal function makes it visible; if it is already visible, the hide function makes it disappear by changing its display status to "none."
Document probably refers to the entire html page; style.display seems to be calling up the css and changing a specific property.

## Your Addition
Add more sections to this website and see if you can get it to replicate the feature.  Play with the HTML-Tags and see what you can and cannot get away with changing.
